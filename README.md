# About
This is a little coding exercise, building a simple PWA example with plain vanilla JavaScript.

There are a lot of comments in the source code and this is a very basic example. So there should be little problems to understand the basic concepts.

The example is only tested on Google Chrome, MS Edge (Chromium) Browser and a Huawei P20 Pro Mobile Phone.

[Try it](https://s01042.github.io/Relax) on github pages.

Remark: think about all the potential vulnerabilities and security issues that may come with intercepting the network traffic between the app and a remote resource. Actually that is what a service worker is doing. That's why a service worker must be **https** hosted because it is a very delicate part of a PWA. Localhost for hosting a service worker is also working. Thats eases development of a PWA.

Fortunately github pages supports https, so there is no problem to host a PWA on there.
